# circuit-using-circom-programming-language

1. **Write a correct circuit.circom implementation:**
   - Define the circuit functionality using the Circom language. Ensure that your circuit accurately represents the logic required for the task.
   - You'll need to define inputs, outputs, and the logical operations necessary to achieve the desired computation.

2. **Compile the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries:**
   - Use the Circom compiler to compile your circuit file (`circuit.circom`). This will generate necessary files for further steps.

3. **Generate a proof using inputs A=0 B=1:**
   - Use a tool like snarkjs to generate a proof for your circuit using the provided inputs A=0 and B=1. This proof will demonstrate that your circuit behaves correctly according to the specified logic.

4. **Deploy a solidity verifier to Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet:**
   - Write a Solidity contract that acts as a verifier for the proof generated in the previous step. This contract should contain a method (`verifyProof()`) to verify the proof against the specified inputs.
   - Deploy this contract to the Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet using a suitable Ethereum development environment like Hardhat or Truffle.

5. **Call the verifyProof() method on the verifier contract and assert output is true:**
   - Once the verifier contract is deployed, write a script or use an Ethereum client (such as Hardhat or Truffle) to interact with the deployed contract.
   - Call the `verifyProof()` method with the generated proof and assert that the output is true, indicating that the proof has been successfully verified by the contract.
